# race & its significant insignificance

I want to address race and its significant insignificance.

Race. It is an idea. No, I am not talking about the biological definition of race. But rather societies numerous implications of race. It's those implications that, at the end of the day, are just ideas. The necessity of mentioning our race in life implies that it actually matters. The fact that we must put it on applications and put it on different government documents says that identifying by our race is relevant. If all men were truly created equal and if that was truly the basis at which the government operated off of, such identifications would be unnecessary.

But lets get to my real point. Despite the fundamental principle in government that "all men are created equal", it's been the government that has made race a central part of their categorization of people. Which spawned from the racist wanting to control black people and well all minorities for that matter. But in time it has now been the people that have internalized race as their own personal identity.

It's important to understand that the internalization of human made ideas (as opposed to God's ideas) can be dangerous. It causes you to blindly accept and defend things regardless of their merits, truth, or lack thereof for both. If someone challenges it, it no longer feels like they are challenging an idea, but rather challenging who you are, usually evoking an emotionally charged response.

The reason I bring this up is because, many times that we speak, you argue for something that, in God's eyes, is nothing. Your skin color is NOTHING to Him. Yet it's a vital part of your identity. You say it's a vital part because people who also internalized race as an identity (racist slave owners), in all their wickedness, have done something wrong to a group people who did not fit their ideals. Wickedness and ignorance came from that internalization then, and it comes from it now. When has it ever been okay to derive your identity from the wrong doing of another? No matter what wrong-doings one did to another, are we not all God's children at the end of the day?

You wanted to know if I thought black lives mattered. Absolutely. Black lives matter. White lives matter. Tan lives matter. Sunburned lives matter. Super pale and pasty lives matter. All lives matter. But as you see the ridiculousness of my list, to segregate them into different categories is to abide by a societal system built to keep us from unifying and coming together. If we stopped internalizing race, I think you'd find how much I, and so many others, truly love people. All people. No matter our skin color. Its honestly the only way we can find the true racists among us.
