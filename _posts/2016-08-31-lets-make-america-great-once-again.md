# let's make America great once again

Let's make America great once again.

I know that is what many of us want to say. But again, we can't. At least not yet. I don't care if he (and now she) tells you he will give you the world. All he (and now she) wants is a 2 minute and 12 second quickie behind the bleachers. If at some point the large majority of us can see through these overused pick up lines, maybe, just maybe we can unite and no longer let them tear us apart.

Every 4 years, those guys that hang out at the bar all day with the shirt unbuttoned two buttons too much, surrounded by the overwhelming smell of drakkar noir stop by the good will to grab a suit. Suit and re-purposed pick up lines in hand, they hit the campaign trail. They talk about all of the things they promise to do if we elect them to office. The things we hear pretty much every election. They talk about the great place America would become if we just pull the lever for them.

But somehow, without fail, as soon as they enter office, they forget all about the amazing things they promised to do for us. This is not familiar just to the right, but to the left as well. It has angered us. All of us. But even in that anger, we cannot seem to unite this election cycle. We are all angry but we are split right down the middle. One side promises greatness, the other a return to principles.

For me, I stand for a return to principles. But for a moment, I want to step away from that. I want to have a conversation with you not in the cloudy stratosphere of the political spectrum. I want to talk to you as a person. Someone who, in all likelihood, is more similar to you than any presidential candidate in the race right now.

Side note: Funny thought isn't it? In the course of political discussions, we tend to get caught up in how much we disagree, subsequently labeling each other as vastly different. All because of a politicians words.

I pay taxes. I go to work every single day. I shop at Kohl's (when the good deals are happening). I get home exhausted from work and flip on the TV or Netflix. I do my best to make good grades in school. I drink. I enjoy loud music. I have a ton of student loan debt. I have never been in a private jet.

With all that in mind, I believe what makes a great country is being united. As a people. Now I don't mean we all have to like House of Cards (If you don't, you haven't lived). We don't all need to love Katy Perry or Beyonce. But we must agree on something. We must introspectively decide what is fit to unite on and what isn't. I would argue that principles are the only things we can unite on as a country. You see, principles have nothing to with whether or not you think Caitlin Jenner should be able to use the same bathroom as your daughter. Principles do not focus on one single issue. They serve as timeless constructs that provide an idea as to what may be right or wrong. What may work and may not work. Principles are called principles because no matter what the small, individual variables are at the moment, principles still can be applied and utilized. They have no last breath.

For example, don't bad mouth other people. I am certain we all can think of a time or two when we should have put this principle into action but didn't. The reasons should be self evident. If you bad mouth people, eventually, in some way, it comes back to bite you in the ass. This principle won't change 30 years down the line. It won't suddenly become better for you to start talking bad about your coworkers just because you can do it with a better cell phone or technological device.

Over 200 years ago, a bunch of men who today we would call wise convened to discuss the ways in which they could fix the ongoing issues with their mother country, England. Through observation and the careful study of every single governmental system in history, they concluded that the way Americans would be best off would be through individual freedom. They figured the less government got involved with our individual dealings, the better we would be.

I think the results are self evident. But in case you do not agree, who is \#1 in GDP? Who provides the most in foreign aid? Hell, lets just leave the number games alone. What country does most every single nation in the world attempt to emulate? What country do music stars and movie stars dream to work in? The United States of America. But maybe even then, you still think the principles of liberty are flawed. So I ask, who knows you, better than you? Who knows what is best for you? Who knows how to take care of your kids better than you? Who knows what to buy for you better than you?

Because last time I checked, it was the smooth talkers running for office stating they know whats better for you, than you. I don't know about you, but I am fed up with the government telling me they are going to take care of it. That they are going to make it all great again. It's time you say, "leave me alone. Get away from me. Stay out of my life". Oh, and not to forget, "don't touch me with those tiny little hands".
